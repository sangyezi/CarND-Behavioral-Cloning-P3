** Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

The `model.py` file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 5x5 or 3x3 filter sizes and depths between 24 and 64. RELU activation is used at each convolutiaon layer to introduce nonlinearity. Fully connected layers of depth 1164 to 1 are added after the convolution layers.

The image was first cropped (top 70 rows of pixels and bottom 25 rows of pixels removed), then the pixel data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer. 

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting.

The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (data randomly shuffled and split as 80% into training set, and 20% into validation set). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually.

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road. 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to fine tune the existing model [published by Nvidia](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) to fit for this problem. Nvidia's model is used for end-to-end learning of real self-driving cars, which face more complicated road and weather conditions, while this model is used for a similar and mainly focus to keep the car on a clear track. 


My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the Nividia model. I thought this model might be appropriate because the problem is a simplier version of the problem solved by that model.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that it contains dropout layer.

Then I tuned model parameters such as dropout rate, number of epoch, batch size.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track, to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I added more training data where I intentionally drove the car off the center without recording, and then drove the car back to center while recording.

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.


#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture consisted of a cropping layer, a normalization layer, five convolution neural layers, a flatten layer and followed by four fully connected layers interleaved by dropout layers. 

Here is a visualization of the architecture generated by keras visualization tool

Actually this model is very similar to the Nvidia model, plotted below

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image3]


I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to how to recover in case it goes off the center. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from right edge of the road, and return back to the center of the road:

In addition, images from left and right cameras with angle corrected by adding and deducing 0.2 are also used to help the vehicle to learn recovery.

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I flipped images and angles thinking that this would simulate driving in the opposite direction. 

I actually also collected the car driving to the opposite direct - clockwise on the track. 


I collected 1.75GB data for track 1. I also collected 0.5GB data for track 2. Because my driving skill is limited and the track is difficult to drive, the data collected on track 2 was not perfect, I sometimes could not control the car well so I shift between the two lines, also sometimes the car get out of control that I have to manually deleted last portion of data collected.


I then preprocessed this data by cropping and normalization as described before.


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. Note because my data set contains both data on track 1 and 2, and because of the validation data set is relatively small, it shows some fluctuation, and I decided to not use early stop to decide the number of epochs based on validation set result, but manually determine the number of epoches based on training set result. The ideal number of epochs was 20 as evidenced below.

I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.

### 4. testing result explanation

I included vides generated by `video.py` for the autonomous driving test on track 1 and 2 in the project (`track1.mp4` and `track2.mp4`)


I also uploaded screen recording fo the test to youtube, as the file size is too large for github ([track 1 screen recording](https://youtu.be/1DHCzYFkIqo),  [track 2 screen recording](https://youtu.be/DIxP_BBfJ28)) The driving test on track 1 is very smooth, and never falls of the road. At the end of the driving test on track 2, the car falls off the track. There are several reasons for this:

1. the data set I collected is not as large as the one I collectd for track 1; 
2. the data I collected on track 2 is not perfect for training due to my limited skill;
3. the steering angle as single input seems not be good enough for autonomous driving on track 2, the car sometimes stop in the middle of the road due to lack of momentum, so I believe speed control should also be included in a model for track 2.
